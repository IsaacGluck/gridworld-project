Set 7
 1. What methods are implemented in Critter?
 	act(), getActors(), processActors(ArrayList<Actor> acotrs), getMoveLocations(), selectMoveLocation(ArrayList<Location> locs), makeMove(Location loc) 

 2. What are the five basic actions common to all critters when they act?
 	Getting a list of other actors, processing that list, getting locations to move to, selectiong one of them, and moving to the selected location
 3.Should subclasses of Critter override the getActors method? Explain.
 	Only if they wish to get actors that are not directly neighboring them.

 4. Describe three ways that a critter could process actors.
 	New actors could be added to blank spaces, existing actors could be removed, or existing actors could be replaced.
 
 5. What three methods must be invoked to make a critter move? Explain each of these methods.
 	getMoveLocations(), selectMoveLocation(ArrayList<Location> locs), and makeMove(Location loc)

 6. Why is there no Critter constructor?
 	It does not contain instance variables that need to be set up nor does it take any user input.


Set 8
1. Because some of the methods that act calls such as processActors and makeMove are overwritten in ChameleonCritter and serve a different purpose.


2. Because all it wants to do is just change the direction, but then it can call all the built in makeMove funcitons in the Critter class.

3.Save the current location in a variable, and then create a flower and add it to this locaiton. (SAme as in Bug class)

4. It wants to use the same behavior as Crriter

5. The Actor class

6. It can use getGrid(). It gets it from Actor (inherited).
